### Qualitative Research
As we are the growing company in the competitive environment like Delhi/NCR, as part to fulfil our mission to fill the gaps of the public transport with an efficient, reliable and comfortable source of transportation, we have decided to expand our services to the new markets.
In order to understand the need of the people, we have done preliminary research to understand what the requirements are; we have randomly chosen around 100 people in the areas near Noida and Gurgaon.
When we have analysed the common concerns from the people, we have found that the basic need is safety, reliability and conformability. In one of the interview Mr Sharma (an account by profession who commutes daily from Noida to Central Delhi) said, “As summers are approaching in few weeks, it’s very difficult to travel in overburdened public transport daily”. 
In another interview, Ms Shalini Reddy (working for an MNC in Gurgaon) said “As my company lacks transportation facility, sometimes it’s not safe to commute in late hours”. Safely is one of the concerns which people concerns in Delhi/NCR especially for ladies.
The trend which we have identified with the response is as below:

### Learnings while doing the assignment
We have tried to measure our Research objectives on various constructs like Necessity, Audience, service quality and affordability. 
Out of all, the most interesting one is the "target audience", as this factor is very important to gain insights of the 
needs of the people who would be using our services.  What are the most important features they look in a transport service provider.
The mission of our company is to bridge the gap of customer expectations and an inefficient transport system.  

The most challenging construct is to measure the customer satisfaction, since people are keen on minor service quality factors.
And a small deviation might be damaging.
We have also measured other constructs like affordability, security which gave us a picture how we doing with our current services.

Since Delhi NCR already has other companies like OLA, Trevo which provide pretty decent services and prices, therefore in order to compete with these 
companies we have to launch our campaign which not only markets Shuttl as a better transport provider, but also proves to be the most economical.

After reviewing the insights of the feedback, we will understand the requirements of our future customers for our future markets which would positively make us the future leaders.
