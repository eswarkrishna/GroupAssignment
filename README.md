In order to understand the need of the people, we have done preliminary research to understand what the requirements are; we have randomly chosen around 100 people in the areas near Noida and Gurgaon.
When we have analysed the common concerns from the people, we have found that the basic need is safety, reliability and conformability. In one of the interview Mr Sharma (an account by profession who commutes daily from Noida to Central Delhi) said, “As summers are approaching in few weeks, it’s very difficult to travel in overburdened public transport daily”.
