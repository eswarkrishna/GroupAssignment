### Qualitative Research
Since we are a growing company in a competitive environment like Delhi NCR, we wish to fulfil the gaps of the public transport with an efficient, reliable and comfortable source.
In order to understand the needs of the people, we have done the required preliminary research. For the purpose, we have randomly chosen people around Delhi NCR and after understanding the common concerns of the people, it is found that the basic necessities are safety, reliability and comfort.
In one of the interview Mr. Sharma (an accountant by profession who commutes daily from Noida to Central Delhi) said, “As summers are approaching in few weeks, it’s very difficult to travel in overburdened public transport daily”. In another interview, Ms. Shalini Reddy (working for an MNC in Gurgaon) said “As my company lacks transportation facility, sometimes it’s not safe to commute in late hours”. Reliability is also one of the major concerns for people in Delhi/NCR as the current transportation system includes many hiccups like traffic jams, etc. due to which timely arrival of transport is one of the biggest challenge in the minds of the people. Also, due to high number of criminal activities in the region, Safety has its own importance. The trend which we have identified with the response is as below:

### Learnings while doing the assignment
We have tried to measure our Research objectives on various constructs like Necessity, Audience, Service quality and Affordability. Out of all, the most interesting one is the "target audience", as this factor is very important to gain insights of the needs of the people who would be using our services i.e. What are the most important features people look in a transport service provider. The mission of our company is to bridge the gap of customer expectations and an inefficient transportation system.

The most challenging construct is to measure the customer satisfaction, since people are keen on minor service quality factors, and a small deviation from which might be damaging. We have also measured other constructs like affordability & security which gave us a picture, how we are doing in the current scenario.

Since Delhi NCR already has other companies like OLA, Trevo, etc. which provide pretty decent services and prices, therefore in order to compete with these companies we have to launch our campaign which not only markets SHUTTL as a better transport provider, but also proves to be the most economical.
